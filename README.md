# Flutter SQLite CRUD App

## Project Overview

This project is a Flutter application that demonstrates how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using a local SQLite database. The app uses several Flutter packages to manage the SQLite database and its file paths. The primary goal of this project is to provide a simple and effective way to manage data locally within a Flutter app.

## Features

- SQLite database integration
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Local data storage using the `sqflite` package
- File path management using the `path` and `path_provider` packages

## Packages Used

- [sqflite](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite): SQLite plugin for Flutter. Supports iOS, Android, and macOS.
- [path](https://pub.dev/packages/path): A string-based path manipulation library.
- [path_provider](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider): A Flutter plugin for finding commonly used locations on the filesystem.
